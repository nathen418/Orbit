# What happened here?
Old design files for an Arduino based clock I was building. Most stuff here is not mine, I was going to modify the files. Lost all of my work. This repo exists only so that I may return to the project at a later date. At the moment I have no energy or will to continue working on it as months of work has been lost. I got as far as fully working code and fully working hardware. I had the pcb's printed and soldered everything onto them. They worked perfectly. I still have all of the 8 revisions to the hardware. MONTHS of work gone, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't know what I am going to do. If I do return to the project, I will have to start from scratch, and will probably choose a Raspberry Pi Pico as the microcontroller, but I really have no idea.

Maybe in the future I will find a backup of the files and return to the project, however this seems unlikely.

Toodles.
